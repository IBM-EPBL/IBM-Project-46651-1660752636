   IoT-based agriculture system helps the farmer in
monitoring different parameters of his field like
soil moisture, temperature, and humidity using 
some sensors.
    
   Farmers can monitor all the sensor parameters by
using a web or mobile application even if the 
farmer is not near his field. Watering the crop
is one of the important tasks for the farmers.

   They can make the decision whether to water the
crop or postpone it by monitoring the sensor 
parameters and controlling the motor pumps from
the mobile application itself.
